    Middleware to extract and store organization context for each request.

    This middleware extracts the organization ID from either the JWT token
    or the X-Organization-ID header and stores it in request.state for use
    by downstream handlers. The organization context is used for:
    - Data isolation in multi-tenant architecture
    - Row Level Security (RLS) policy enforcement
    - Authorization checks

    The organization context is optional - endpoints that require it should
    explicitly validate its presence using require_organization_context().

    Args:
        request: Incoming HTTP request
        call_next: Next middleware/handler in the chain

    Returns:
        Response from the next handler

    Note:
        - Organization ID is stored in request.state.organization_id
        - Does not fail if organization ID is not present
        - Individual endpoints are responsible for enforcing organization context
