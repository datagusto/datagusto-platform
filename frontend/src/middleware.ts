/**
 * Next.js Middleware
 *
 * @description Middleware for handling route-level logic before requests reach pages.
 * Currently configured for future authentication enhancements.
 *
 * **Current Limitations**:
 * - localStorage-based auth cannot be accessed in middleware (server-side)
 * - Authentication checks are handled client-side in layout components
 *
 * **Future Enhancements** (when migrating to HttpOnly cookies):
 * - Server-side authentication verification
 * - Automatic redirects for protected routes
 * - Token refresh handling
 *
 * @module middleware

 * Protected routes that require authentication
 *
 * @description List of route patterns that should be protected.
 * Currently not enforced in middleware due to localStorage limitations.

 * When HttpOnly cookies are implemented, middleware will check authentication
 * and redirect unauthenticated users to /sign-in automatically.

 * Middleware function

 * @description Executes before requests reach pages.
 * Currently passes through all requests due to localStorage auth limitations.
 *
 * **Current Behavior**:
 * - Logs request information in development mode
 * - Passes all requests through without blocking
 * - Authentication is handled client-side by DashboardLayout
 *
 * **Why Not Enforce Auth Here?**:
 * - localStorage is only accessible on client-side (browser)
 * - Middleware runs on server-side (cannot read localStorage)
 * - Client-side layouts (DashboardLayout) handle auth checks and redirects
 *
 * **Future Implementation** (with HttpOnly cookies):
 * ```typescript
 * const token = request.cookies.get('access_token');
 * if (isProtectedRoute && !token) {
 *   return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/sign-in', request.url));
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param request - Next.js request object
 * @returns Next.js response (currently always NextResponse.next())
